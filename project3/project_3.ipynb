    "In this project, you will begin working with COBRA (COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis) methods using the Python library [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/). Originally implemented in MATLAB as the COBRA Toolbox, cobrapy is an object-oriented programming framework for the reconstruction and analysis of constraint-based metabolic models. Although still not as comprehensive as the COBRA Toolbox when it comes to modeling capabilities and implemented algorithms, it provides ample functionality to cover our needs for this course. Before starting with this project, I strongly encourage you to take a look at the [documentation](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and [API reference](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/index.html) where you will find useful descriptions and minor tutorials on how to work with the library. We will also be using the web-based tool [Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/}) for the visualization of metabolic pathway maps and calculated flux phenotypes.\n"
