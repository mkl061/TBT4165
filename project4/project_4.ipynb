    "\n",
    "In this project, you will be continuing your work with the *Escherichia coli* core model and investigate how the growth phenotype of the model changes when varying one or multiple exchange fluxes (i.e., production envelopes and phenotype phase planes). Additionally, you will be conducting a gene essentiality analysis on the model where the deletion of a gene can be simulated by simply constraining the lower and upper flux bounds of its associated reactions to 0. Gene deletion analysis is a common application of genome-scale metabolic models and allow us to assess the effects of a gene deletion on the metabolic phenotype of an organism before initiating expensive and time-consuming experiments in the lab. I recommend taking a look at the cobrapy documentation before starting with the project, particularly the section on deletion analysis found [here](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deletions.html).\n"
